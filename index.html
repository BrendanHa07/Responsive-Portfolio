        <p>Hi there! My name is Brendan Ha and I welcome you to my page. A little bit about me is that I graduated from UCLA in 2011 with a degree in biology. I currently work at a microbiological lab that focuses on food safety. We do a variety of food safety testing for the greater Southern California area. I chose to get into coding because I felt as though a career change was in order. Technology and computers have always interested me and I believe that this is the right time to dive into this exciting and innovating field.</p>
        <p>Some of the things that make me tick include basketball, attending concerts, and craft beer. There is nothing better than going to either a Lakers game or concert and downing a cold, frosty microbrew!</p>
